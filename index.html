                Hashtags: Using relevant hashtags helps expose your content to a
                wider audience interested in similar topics or themes as yours.
                Research trending hashtags within your niche using tools like
                Display Purposes, then incorporate them into your captions
                strategically without overdoing it (aim for around 5-10 per
                post). Geotags: Adding geotags to your posts can help you reach
                local users and increase visibility in specific locations. This
                is especially useful for businesses targeting a regional
                audience or influencers attending events where they want their
                content to be discovered by others nearby.

                Rather than jumping straight into collaboration proposals, it’s
                essential first to establish rapport with potential influencers.
                Engage genuinely with their content by liking, commenting on
                their posts or sharing them on stories. This will make them
                notice you over time. You may also send direct messages
                appreciating their work but avoid being overly promotional
                initially. Show genuine interest in their work — don’t just talk
                about yourself. Avoid spamming — be patient when waiting for
                responses from busy individuals. Sending Collaboration Proposals
                Once you’ve connected with the influencer, it’s time to pitch
                your collaboration idea. Personalize your message and explain
                how working together will benefit both parties.
